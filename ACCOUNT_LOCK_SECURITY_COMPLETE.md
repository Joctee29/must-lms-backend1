# 🎯 FINAL STATUS - Account Lock/Unlock Feature

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY SECURE & PRODUCTION READY  
**All Changes:** Committed & Pushed to GitHub

---

## The Problem You Reported

```
Nikilock user kwenye admin portal inaonesha amekuwa locked
LAKINI user bado akija kwenye portal akaweza kuingia kama kawaida
```

**In English:** Lock button shows account as locked BUT user can still login.

---

## The Fix (Now Complete!)

### What Was Missing
Login endpoints (`/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth`) haiku-check if account is locked!

### What We Added
**Login validation** kwenye 3 endpoints:
1. ✅ Student login - Check `is_locked` status
2. ✅ Lecturer login - Check `is_locked` status  
3. ✅ JWT auth endpoint - Check `is_locked` status

### How It Works Now
```
User tries to login
    ↓
Backend checks: is_locked = true?
    ↓
YES → ❌ Return 403 error "Account is locked"
NO  → ✅ Allow login (continue normal process)
```
