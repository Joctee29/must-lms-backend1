# Quick Reference - Discussion Section Fixes

## What Changed?

### 1. Student Portal - Reply Badges 🔖
**File**: `student-system/src/pages/Discussions.tsx` (Line 1010-1020)

**Change**: Updated how reply badges display to clearly identify message sources

| Message Type | Old Badge | New Badge | Color |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| From Lecturer | "lecture" | "LECTURER" | Orange |
| From Student | "student" | "STUDENT (REG-12345)" | Blue |
| Admin | "Admin" | "Admin" | Purple |

**What Students See Now**:
- Lecturer reply with orange "LECTURER" badge - can't miss it!
- Student reply with blue "STUDENT (REG-12345)" badge - know who answered
- Clear color-coding system

---

### 2. Lecture Portal - Discussion Card Structure 📋
**File**: `lecture-system/src/pages/Discussions.tsx` (Line 393-480)

**Change**: Completely redesigned discussion card layout to match student portal

**New Structure**:
```
[Avatar] Title
         Category Badge
         Author • Program • Time
         
         Content Preview
         
         Study Group Info (if applicable)
         
         Replies: 5  Likes: 3  Views: 42  Last 2h ago
         
         [View Replies] [Reply]
```

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ Single clear title (was shown twice)
- ✅ Linear layout (was nested & complex)
- ✅ Category badge clearly visible
- ✅ Action buttons explicit
- ✅ Now matches student portal exactly

## How to Test

### Student Portal - Check the Badges
1. Go to **Discussions** section
2. Open any discussion with replies
3. Look at the reply badges:
   - Lecturer reply: Should show **orange "LECTURER"** badge
   - Student reply: Should show **blue "STUDENT (REG-XXXX)"** badge
4. ✅ If you see these clearly, it's working!

### Lecture Portal - Check the Layout
1. Go to **Course Discussions**
2. Look at discussion cards:
   - [Avatar] on the left ✅
   - Title at the top ✅
   - Author • Program • Time below ✅
   - Content preview in middle ✅
   - Stats (Replies/Likes/Views) at bottom ✅
   - Action buttons clearly visible ✅
3. Compare with student portal - should look the same!
