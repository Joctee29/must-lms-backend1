# ASSIGNMENT AND MATERIAL FIXES - COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

## 🎯 ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issue 1: Assignment Workflow Problem
**Problem**: Lecturers send assignments but students can't see them in the student portal.

**Root Cause**: The system has TWO separate assignment systems:
1. **Assessments** - Created via Assessment.tsx (new system)
2. **Assignments** - Created via NewAssignments.tsx (traditional system)

Students were only fetching from the assessments API, missing traditional assignments.

**Solution**: Modified `StudentAssignments.tsx` to fetch from BOTH systems and merge results.

### Issue 2: Material Viewing/Download Persistence
**Problem**: Materials work initially but can't be viewed/downloaded after logout and re-login.

**Root Cause**: The system was creating temporary blob URLs in memory that are lost when the session ends.

**Solution**: Changed to use direct backend URLs that persist across sessions.

## 🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES

### 1. Student Assignment Portal (`student-system/src/pages/StudentAssignments.tsx`)

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Fetch from `/api/assessments?status=published` (new system)
- ✅ Fetch from `/api/assignments` (traditional system)
- ✅ Merge both results into unified list
- ✅ Filter by student's program
- ✅ Sort by deadline (earliest first)
- ✅ Add type identification (`assessment` vs `assignment`)

**Code Flow**:
```javascript
// 1. Get student's enrolled programs
const studentPrograms = programsResult.data.filter(p => 
  p.course_id === studentData.course_id
);

// 2. Fetch assessments (new system)
const assessmentsResponse = await fetch('.../api/assessments?status=published');
const formattedAssessments = studentAssessments.map(assessment => ({
  id: `assessment_${assessment.id}`,
  type: 'assessment',
  // ... other fields
}));

// 3. Fetch traditional assignments (old system)
const assignmentsResponse = await fetch('.../api/assignments');
const formattedTraditionalAssignments = studentTraditionalAssignments.map(assignment => ({
  id: `assignment_${assignment.id}`,
  type: 'assignment',
  // ... other fields
}));

// 4. Combine and sort
allAssignments = [...formattedAssessments, ...formattedTraditionalAssignments];
allAssignments.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.deadline) - new Date(b.deadline));
```

### 2. Material Viewing (`student-system/src/pages/Index.tsx`)

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Removed temporary blob URL creation
- ✅ Use direct backend URLs: `https://must-lms-backend.onrender.com${material.file_url}`
- ✅ Simplified video viewing (direct browser player)
- ✅ Use Google Docs Viewer for office documents
- ✅ Persistent URLs across sessions

**Before**:
```javascript
// Created temporary blob URLs that were lost after logout
const blob = new Blob([videoContent], { type: 'text/html' });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
window.open(url, '_blank');
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Direct persistent URLs
const fullUrl = `https://must-lms-backend.onrender.com${material.file_url}`;
window.open(fullUrl, '_blank');
```

### 3. Backend API Enhancement (`backend/server.js`)

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added detailed logging for assignment queries
- ✅ Improved query to sort by deadline (ASC) for students
- ✅ Added console logs to track assignment retrieval

## 🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS

### Assignment Issues

**Check Browser Console**:
```javascript
// Look for these logs:
"=== FETCHING ASSIGNMENTS ==="
"Student programs: [...]"
"All published assessments: [...]"
"All traditional assignments: [...]"
"=== FINAL COMBINED ASSIGNMENTS ==="
"Total assignments found: X"
```

**Check Backend Logs**:
```javascript
// Look for these logs:
"=== ASSIGNMENTS API DEBUG ==="
"Active assignments for students found: X"
"Assignments: [...]"
```

**Common Issues**:
1. **No assignments showing**:
   - Check if student is enrolled in programs
   - Check if assignments have correct program_name
   - Check if assignments are not expired
   - Check if assignments have status 'active' or 'published'

2. **Program name mismatch**:
   - Ensure program names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM programs WHERE course_id = X`
   - Check assignments: `SELECT * FROM assignments WHERE program_name = 'X'`

### Material Issues

**Check Browser Console**:
```javascript
// Look for these logs:
"=== VIEW MATERIAL DEBUG ==="
"Material: {...}"
"File URL: /uploads/..."
"Full URL: https://must-lms-backend.onrender.com/uploads/..."
"Opening viewable file: ..."
```

**Common Issues**:
1. **File not found after logout**:
   - ✅ FIXED: Now using direct backend URLs
   - Check if file exists: `ls backend/uploads/`
   - Check file_url in database: `SELECT file_url FROM content WHERE id = X`

2. **Video not playing**:
   - Check video format (MP4 works best)
   - Check file size (large files may take time to load)
   - Check backend serves static files: `app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'))`

3. **Office documents not opening**:
   - Google Docs Viewer requires publicly accessible URL
   - Check if backend URL is accessible from internet
   - Alternative: Download and open locally

## 🎓 PROGRAM MATCHING LOGIC

### How Students See Assignments

1. **Get Student Data**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM students WHERE username = 'student123'
   ```

2. **Get Student's Programs**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM programs WHERE course_id = student.course_id
   ```

3. **Filter Assignments**:
   ```javascript
   const programNames = studentPrograms.map(p => p.name);
   // ["Computer Science", "Data Structures", "Algorithms"]
   
   const matchingAssignments = allAssignments.filter(assignment =>
     programNames.includes(assignment.program_name)
   );
   ```

4. **Check Status and Deadline**:
   ```javascript
   const activeAssignments = matchingAssignments.filter(assignment =>
     (assignment.status === 'active' || assignment.status === 'published') &&
     new Date(assignment.deadline) > new Date()
   );
   ```

## 📞 SUPPORT

### If Assignments Still Not Showing

1. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if assignments exist
   SELECT * FROM assignments WHERE status = 'active';
   SELECT * FROM assessments WHERE status = 'published';
   
   -- Check student's programs
   SELECT p.* FROM programs p
   JOIN courses c ON p.course_id = c.id
   JOIN students s ON s.course_id = c.id
   WHERE s.username = 'student123';
   ```

2. **Check API Responses**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Look for `/api/assignments` and `/api/assessments` calls
   - Check response data

3. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Browser console (F12)
   - Backend server logs

### If Materials Not Working

1. **Check File Exists**:
   ```bash
   ls backend/uploads/
   ```

2. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, file_url FROM content WHERE id = X;
   ```

3. **Test Direct URL**:
   - Copy file URL from database
   - Try accessing: `https://must-lms-backend.onrender.com/uploads/filename.ext`
   - Should download or display file
