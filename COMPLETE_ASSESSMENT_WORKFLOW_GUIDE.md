### **🎯 SCENARIO 3: MIXED AUTO-GRADE WORKFLOW**

#### **Step 1: Create Mixed Assessment**
```
1. ✅ Enable Auto-Grading
2. Add Questions:
   - 2x Multiple Choice (auto-gradable)
   - 2x True/False (auto-gradable)
   - Would add Short Answer but they're HIDDEN in auto-mode
3. This creates pure auto-grade assessment
```

**Note:** In current implementation, Auto-Grade = ON hides Short Answer questions, so mixed assessments aren't possible. This ensures clear workflow separation.

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **🎯 ASSESSMENT CREATION LOGIC**
```javascript
// Auto-Grade ON: Hide Short Answer, show correct answer fields
{newAssessment.autoGrade && (
  <input type="radio" checked={correctAnswer === index} />
)}

// Auto-Grade OFF: Show all questions, hide correct answer fields
{!newAssessment.autoGrade && (
  <option value="short-answer">Short Answer</option>
)}
```

### **🎯 BACKEND GRADING ENGINE**
```javascript
if (assessment.auto_grade === true) {
  // AUTO MODE: Grade MC/T-F automatically
  questions.forEach(question => {
    if (question.type === 'multiple-choice') {
      if (studentAnswer === question.correctAnswer) {
        autoGradedScore += question.points;
      }
    }
  });
  status = 'auto-graded';
} else {
  // MANUAL MODE: All questions = 0 (awaiting manual)
  finalScore = 0;
  status = 'submitted';
}
```

### **🎯 LECTURER INTERFACE LOGIC**
```javascript
{selectedAssessment.autoGrade ? (
  <Button className="text-blue-600">Auto Grade All</Button>
) : (
  <Button className="text-orange-600">Manual Grade All</Button>
)}
```

### **🎯 STUDENT FLOW LOGIC**
```javascript
// After submission, remove from Take Assessment
setAvailableAssessments(prev => 
  prev.filter(assessment => assessment.id !== currentAssessment.id)
);

// Appears in Assessment Results automatically
// Status updates based on grading progress
```
